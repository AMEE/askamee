# AskAMEE

All the action occurs in the Question controller.

Look in the lib directory for all the magic parsing code.

You pass a string into `Quantify.parse`, and Quantify turns it into a series of series of quantities, and 'other' strings. Other, non-unit strings are dumped into an array.

`#extract_journey` will then try to parse the 'non-unit' terms for airport codes

Next we check quantities against a few NOT_NUMBERS, like 747's, or Renault car numbers

Next we have terms we can pipe into an AMEE search.

When we have results, from the search we then check for matching units.

If they match we perform the calculation and return the result.
